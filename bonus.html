    <h3>Kensington Kayden</h3>
    <!--Letter K-->
    <p>Many people know the Town mascot as the Great Neck Giraffe, but many people do not know of its origins.

        The Kensington Giraffe is located on the village green, one of the village many green spaces, right across from
        Middle Neck Road. The Giraffe sculpture designed by and built by Nat Epstein, a resident of Great Neck. Mr.
        Epstein, an amateur sculpture who has had some of his work displayed at the Chiam Weizman Institute and Temple
        Beth El Synagogue, was a long time Great Neck resident until his retirement to Florida in 1969. Unfortunately
        Mr. Epstein passed away in 1976 before his statue found a home.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Place named Great Neck is not makeup from the Girrafe neck but animal Giraffe is seleted because of Great neck Location name</li>
        <li>
            Mr. Epstein wanted his work to be displayed in a public place, in 1980 the status is also placed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Recently the welding holding that held the head in place has loosened and during the winter months when the trees are bare the giraffe appears headless
